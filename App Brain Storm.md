App Brain Storm 
--------------------------
Idea 1: Bag of Holding 
What: Bag of Holding is an app designed to help users organize their Video Games across platforms and allow them to track their progress in achievements, date added, and more. 

Who: The app is designed for gamers who use multiple platforms like Switch, Playstation 1-5, xbox and more.

Why: Gamers will add many different games and use different platforms throughout their lifetime. It can be very easy to forget how long you have played a game, when you bought it, or how many achievements you have in a game. Older platforms also lack online connection, so there is no way to know how long you have played a game for. 

Challenges: Finding APIs to get infomation for games and users. Camera usage will also be needed to scan barcodes to link games to accounts. Older platforms pose a challenge to efficently find infomation. 

Idea 2: Wacky Inflatable Vacation

What: People who need to plan vacations have no imagination. Real vacation experts recommended not planning anything and going with the flow. That's why we at Wacky Inflatable Vacation are creating a revolutionary, disrupting, paradigm shifting,Big Data,,Machine Learning app to achieve the greatest thrill ride of a vacation you will ever experience. 

(We aim to create an app where each day of your vacation is generated from a random list of things to see, experience, and eat.Users can muligan one thing from the day)

Who: Real vacation enthusiasts who have found the true knowledge hidden away by Big Planning. 

(People who want to have a fun vacation that is different from anyone elses and even repeat visits will be different if they ever go back again)

Why: Big Planning has stunted vacations the world over. Back in my day (2002), we used to throw a dart at a map and we would go there. Dart landed in the middle of the ocean, we go to the ocean. We had none of these new fangled shills of big planning like trip advisor, yelp, or trivago. 

(We want users to create fun, exciting, memorable vacations without worrying about burning out all the places a destination offers. It also takes away the stress of creating the perfect vacation and lets users live like a local)

Challenges: BIG PLANNING

(We would need real places for people to visit. Most likely we would need some sort of API. We could also add an account feature so people can log in and keep track of their vacation. The places would also need to make sense. We can't send people to visit Miami for example and then have them go to Gainsville, 7 or so hours away in one day.)

Idea 3: Ticket?

What: An app that can be used to compare ticket prices across websites like ticketmaster, stubhub, seatgeek, and more. 

Who: Users who want the best deals for the hottest tickets in the area from Taylor Swift, Mitski, Travis Scott, and more. 

Why: Ticket buying had become more complex in recent years due to the numerous websites specializing in ticket resale poping up and scalpers buying up tickets. We want users to find the tickets for the events they want with greater ease and the understanding that they are receiving the best value tickets. 

Challenges: API access is needed. We would need to compare data from various sources which could be in diferent formats. There would also need to be redirects to the websites for users to buy tickets. 

Idea 4: My God, It's Full of Stars

What: Allows users to find celestial obejcts in the the sky easier. 

Who: Novices to the field of Astronomy or people who are curious about the night sky. 

Why: Beginners can have a hard time finding stars and other objects in the sky. The app aims to improve the experience. 

Challenges: We would need some way to accurately capture the sky at a given time and place. There would need to be an accurate map of the user's area. So, the images and map must be of a high definition. 

Idea 5: Green Utopia

What: An app designed to help users keep track of their groceries and prevent spoilage. 

Who: A wide range of users but partically those that have busy day to day lives where it can be easy to forget when you bought something. It can also be used to see what you have in the fridge, so you can plan your dinner on the way home from work. The app can also be used to track cosmestic products. 

Why: Often times, we buy things from the green grocier and you forget when you bought something. By the time you find it again, you could have bought an extra when the orginal is still usable or its expired when you want to use it. Using Green Utopia, you can cut the food waste, better plan your meals, and live a healthy life.

Challenges: We would have to get permissions from users for camera and photo usage. There would also need to be notifications for when something is about to expire. So, permssions for those too. Dates of things would also have to be stored.
